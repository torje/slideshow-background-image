Since I am too n00b to actually understand how to use the other tools to make a slideshow background I had to write it myself. 

This script requires "feh" installed, should be in all repositories. 

Put the pictures you want in the slideshow in a folder containing nothing else. 
Set this path in the $backgrounddirectory variable. 
choose how long each picture is shown with the $sleeptimer variable.
